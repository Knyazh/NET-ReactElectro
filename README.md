# NET-ReactElectro
NET-ReactElectro is a modern electronic commerce platform developed using a combination of cutting-edge technologies. The frontend of the platform is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library known for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering through the virtual DOM. This allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces. On the backend, the platform utilizes ASP.NET Web API to handle HTTP-based communication and provide a robust infrastructure for managing data and business logic. The data access layer is powered by Entity Framework, which simplifies database operations and provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework.

In addition to these core technologies, NET-ReactElectro incorporates modern authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth 2.0 or JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to ensure secure user authentication and authorization. Furthermore, the platform leverages various frontend libraries and tools, such as React Router for routing and navigation, Redux for state management, and Material-UI or Bootstrap for designing user interface components, to enhance the overall user experience.

By combining these technologies, NET-ReactElectro aims to deliver a seamless and secure electronic commerce experience, providing users with a user-friendly interface for browsing a wide range of electronic products, securely processing payments, and managing their orders effectively.
